# Lenovo ThinkPad T480s

## Why Choose A ThinkPad?
- Durable and repairable (maybe even upgradeable!)
- Great keyboard and trackpoint is useful sometimes
- Can be found on the used market for a good price (avoid low resolution panels though)
- Great community on [r/ThinkPad](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/) in case you have some questions or ideas
- Just looks good in my opinion, I even carbon fiber wrapped mine
- Works okay with Linux (fingerprint reader on some models like mine can have some issues)
- Great port selection (at least on my T480s)
