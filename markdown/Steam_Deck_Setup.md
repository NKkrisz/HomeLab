# Steam Deck

- ExtremeRate Black Transparent Shell 
- Mepatem Case 
- Original Buttons
- Skull&Co Thumbstick and Back Button Grips. 
- Rubber Rings on thumbsticks so it's a bit quieter. 
- Swapped from 64GB to 256GB Samsung PM991a SSD. 
- Somfoon Antiglare Screen Protector (it makes the image less colorful and sharp but it's anti glare is really good and extra protection is nice).

## The process

The shell swap took a whole day and a bit more, scariest part was getting the screen out. Had to use some of the original screws instead of what was given by ExtremeRate (maybe I swapped some, the tutorial isn't very clear about which screws to use as the pictures don't really show the length of them). Used a hair dryer and the metal + some of my own plastic tools to pry up the screen. Make sure to not go deep on the right edge because that's where the screen's cables are. Getting the glue off was a bit tedious too but it's possible as you can see.
