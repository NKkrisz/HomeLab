## Why Make This?
- I got free networking gear from a very nice person (basically all Ubiquiti stuff here)
- I've been interested in self hosting before building this
    - I hosted Plex on an old Dell laptop as my first homelab-esque project
- I wanted to learn new things related to networking and operating more complex systems
    - Virtual machines (Proxmox), Docker (SoonTM), General Linux knowledge etc...
- I need more storage / backups for my files and media
- I like doing cool things with hardware
    - Getting the Lenovo MiniPC to work as a NAS with a HBA and replacing fans on a network switch is really *cool* in my opinion
- I've got inspired by:
