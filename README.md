### This repository
- Probably rebrand/rename this repository in the future as it's now more general tech things I do
- Add a markdown file linking to guides I made or copy them over to here
- **Rename files so they don't contain white spaces**
### Steam Deck
- Make post about average r/SteamDeck_2 user (compilation of previous polls' results)
- Undervolting or overclocking the Steam Deck? (post to r/SteamDeck_2)
- **Add some of C418's music to the Steam Deck "Decky" Audio Loader plugin? [Decky_Audio_Packs Repository WIP](https://github.com/NKkrisz/Decky_Audio_Packs)**
### Server
- Try setting up SyncThing on all devices (laptop, desktop, Steam Deck, phone)
- **Make backups of important things to server**
- Add new storage setup details
- Remove bad drive/s
- Setup VPN
### Main PC / Laptop / Phone
- Maybe try Fedora KDE again on main PC and perhaps laptop too (may wait until Fedora 40, but first I have to review the headphones)
- Maybe try installing a custom ROM to my old tablet (and phone too?)
- Reset VSCode, Firefox and my phone
### Upcoming Reviews
- **Sennheiser HD580 Precision Headphones and compare to Superlux HD681B (restart writing it)**
- Maybe category: ThinkPad T480s, Sony LinkBuds S, Pixel 6a, Steam Deck
- **Nullmini ear/head paddings that I've got for the HD580**
- Add images of each item to this repository
